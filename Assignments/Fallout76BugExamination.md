#### Stabilitiy and performance issue: Console: The player could encounter an infinite loading screen when signing out of their console account while playing Fallout 76.
Type of testing: Compatibility Testing 
### Issue 2
#### User Interface: Respawn: Players who die while severely overencumbered will have all map markers removed when attempting to respawn. The player would have to restart at the original start point after respawning.
Type of testing: Black Box, Acceptance testing. The player wouldn't want to have the inconvenience of having their markers removed over a death. Testing to meet the requirements and convenience for the consumer is my reason for choosing this testing method.
### Issue 3
#### User Interface: Enemies: Red crosshairs and enemy health bars stay on-screen when an enemy is not in sight.
Type of testing:
