## Super Monkey Ball

##### Super Monkey Ball is a platformer and party type game that was developed by Amusement Vision and published by Sega. The software was released for Nintendo Gamecube on September 14, 2001 in Japan and on November 18, 2001 in North America. In the main portion of the game, the user uses the analog stick to tilt the map and roll a monkey that is cased inside a ball into the goal successfully. There are three difficulties that bring a decent challenge and slightly change the map according to the player's selected difficulty level.
### Features to test: 
#### Controller stick to control movement of the stage.
* The tilt of the controller stick is a feature that accurately replicates the movement on the stage and enables the player to move. The user can utilze the physics in the game to preform unique stunts and pass into the goal without a fall out. Some players speed run or attempt playing through the levels by making trick shots into the goal as their main premise. Some levels even have hidden goals which the player can achieve by taking risks with trick shots. 
#### Indication of passing through the goal.
* Another important feature to test for is the indication of the selected player passing through the goal. Preferably, the ball stops rolling and ascends into the next level. The player would have to reach the goal and check if the intended action occurs as planned. The goal can not be reached by touching the sides of the goal, but rather pass in between the posts and through the goal.
#### Bananas and their use to gain extra lives. 
* Bananas are a collectable item in the game with incentive. Initially, the player has 3 lives per continue. When the player collects one hundred of the item, they receive an extra life. Each banana is worth one and each bundle is worth ten bananas. On the opposite end, a fall out results in one life lost. The software does in fact give the player an extra life for collecting the amount of bananas required and properly subtract a life for a player's fall out.

###### (A Fall Out is defined by a player falling off the map or level without reaching the goal)
