### Features to test: 
#### Controller stick to control movement of the stage to roll the ball.
* The tilt of the controller stick is a feature that accurately replicates the movement on the stage and enables the player to move. The user can utilze the physics in the game to preform unique stunts and pass into the goal without a fall out. Some players speed run or attempt playing through the levels by making trick shots into the goal as their main premise. Some levels even have hidden goals which the player can achieve by taking risks with trick shots. 

#### Indication of passing through the goal.
* Another important feature to test for is the indication of the selected player passing through the goal. Preferably, the ball stops rolling and ascends into the next level. The player would have to reach the goal and check if the intended action occurs as planned. The goal can not be reached by touching the sides of the goal, but rather pass in between the posts and through the goal.
#### Collection of Banana items. 
* Bananas are a collectable item in the game with incentive. Initially, the player has 3 lives per continue. When the player collects one hundred of the item, they receive an extra life. Each banana is worth one and each bundle is worth ten bananas. On the opposite end, a fall out results in one life lost.
