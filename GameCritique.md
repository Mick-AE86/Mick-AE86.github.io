Some important aspects of the game to be tested include: The many play styles of the game, the calibration, and the compatibility of the separate Drum controller produced by Hori.
The different play styles should be tested primarily since otherwise the game will not be playable. There are 4 play styles that the game supports. The first is the motion controls, the game utilizes the joycons as drumsticks and prompts the player to play on an imaginary drum. The player strikes downward to hit the drum and strikes at an angle to hit the rim. This is important to test the accuracy of because the player may most likely play using the joycon controls. When playing with the motion controls, the joycons are responsive for the most part however the problem lies with striking at certain angles, there is a specific angle the joycon must be moved in order to hit the rim of the drum. Alternatively, the developers did make the issue easily solved by holding onto the "L" or "R" button on the joycon to strie the rim. However the joycon itself can still be a bit sensitive in regards to movement.
