Some important aspects of the game that is important to test include: The many play styles of the game, the calibration, and the compatibility of the separate Drum controller produced by Hori.
#
The different play styles should be tested primarily since otherwise the game will not be playable. There are 4 play styles that the game supports. The first is the motion controls, the game utilizes the joycons as drumsticks and prompts the player to play on an imaginary drum. The player strikes downward to hit the drum and strikes at an angle to hit the rim. Testing the accuracy of the joycon controls is essential. When playing with the motion controls, the joycons are responsive for the most part however the problem lies with striking at certain angles, there is a specific angle the joycon must be moved in order to hit the rim of the drum. Alternatively, the developers did solve the issue by having the user hold the "L" or "R" button on the joycon to strike the rim. However the joycon itself can still be a bit sensitive in regards to movement. After moving the joycon back into the ready position to perform the next strike the game will register the movement itself as a drum strike.
#
Another play style supported by the game is button controls. Don't like motion controls? The player can press the buttons to "strike the drum". The layout can be changed to fit the user's comfort as well. The testers must test to see if the buttons of a specific layout register properly and that there is no lag after pressing the button. This feature is crucial in rhythm games. If the timing is not well, the game will be viewed as bad.
#
The player is also able to use the touch screen on the console. Of course, this feature can only be played in handheld mode. In handheld mode, a taiko drum is displayed on the screen, the player will touch the drum to strike it and touch outside it to strike the rim. It is key that the touch screen is responsive and ensures the control is correctly calibrated to the shape of the drum.
#
The last play stye utilizes the taiko drum controller created by HORI. HORI is currently partnered with Nintendo to create products and accessories for the Switch console. Testing this third party controller for functionality and compatability with the software is important mainly because the product is advertised alongside the port of the game. If the controller does not work properly, the consumer will be let down and the company could risk losing money.
#
The timing calibration is vital for a rhythm game. The consumer expects for the input to register along with the notes of the music.
