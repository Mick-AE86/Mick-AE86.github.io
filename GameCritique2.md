 Critique 2
 // As per the assignment, I've decided to take this opportunity to critique an indie software known as Shikhondo.
 Developed and published by Deer Farm. (some versions were published in cooperation with Digerati)
 Shikhondo is a bullet helll shmup game which hass the player fight yokai. 
 Released on Steam, PS4, and Switch.
 
 Some aspects that should be tested include player movement, bullet patterns, bullet collisions, and player hitbox collision.
 
 Player movement: One issue I came across while playing is sometimes while continuosly strafing, the character may become unable to move along
 the X-axis and becomes restricted to Y-axis movement. To solve this the player must release the joy stick and press in the desired direction. 
 However by then, the player may waste time and perhaps even struck by enemy bullets. Bullet hell games are known for their insane difficulty.
 
 Bullet Patterns: Besides testing to ensure the bullets properly display the desired patterns, the tester would also have to ensure the patterns 
 are fair towards the player to ensure they can maneuver through the patterns and whatever the enemies may hurl their way.
 
 Bullet collisions: What's a bullet hell game whithout collision. If there is no collision, there is no challenge.
 
 Hitbox collisiion: The player's hitbox must be able to collide with enemy bullets and react accordingly via a life deduction 
 towards the player or another type of penalty.
