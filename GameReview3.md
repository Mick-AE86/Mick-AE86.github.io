## Title: Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater

Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is a stealth action game in which the main protagonist Naked Snake is sent on a mission in 1960's Russia to infiltrate and take out a superweapon which has been in development for a bit of time. The initial release of the game arrived on the Playstation 2 in North America on November 17, 2004 followed by Japan release on December 16, 2004. A European version was released the following year on March 4. The reader should be aware though that this review is based on the initial release of the game and not the secondary release, the remastered version released as a collection on the Playstation 3, or the Nintendo 3DS release.

## Review
The game is fun to play during free time if one is a fan of stealth games. Highly regarded as the best Metal Gear game by fans, many enjoy singing the theme song of the intro. Especially the phrase, "Snaaaaaaaaaaaaaake Eaaaaaater". You may have seen many people quote the famous line, "I give my life. Not for honor, but for you." or other variations of the quote. Perhaps may have even stumbled upon the picture of Snake saluting, usually posted when something sad has occured whether be online or in real life. The core fans hold the game as one of their most favorite childhood experiences.
Just as the previous games, the player is sent on an important mission and is able to sneak around and cycle through their inventory to strategize a tactful takedown of enemies. In this game, some new features that are added include camoflouge suits to assist blending in with the given environment and taking on enemies with hand to hand combat or as it is refered to as Close Quarters Combat (CQC).
As stated before, the game is fun to play and for the most part the controls are very precise, however sometimes the controls can be a bit clunky. For example when hanging off a ledge, in order to climb back up the player would have to push the triangle button and the direction of the ledge to do so. Sometimes the player moves sideways instead of coming up on the ledge. Another example would be dodge rolling. In order to do so, the player must move in the direction they wish to roll in and press the X button. At times the game doesn't register the roll properly and instead the player drops to the ground to floor crawl, making tense moments when spotted by the enemy a bit frustrating. The camera is also another issue in that it limited the player's view such that detecting enemies made it more difficult. That aside, the game is amusing to the fact that the jokes and 4th wall breaking keep the player coming back for more. Speaking of coming back for more, there is a boss level in which if the player exits the game during The End's boss fight and returns a week later, The End passes away. What was normally supposed to be a difficult battle can be easily beaten via this route.

## Final Thoughts
The game is fun to play and some of the issues mentioned above have been fixed in the rereleases of the game. I'd suggest picking up those copies for those who want a more pleasant experience. The original version is decent as well and even prefered by some hardcore fans of the series. Some of the silly jokes from the characters and the game make the experience even more enjoyable.
