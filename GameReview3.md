## Title: Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater

Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is a stealth action game in which the main protagonist Naked Snake is sent on a mission in 1960's Russia to infiltrate and take out a superweapon which has been in development for a bit of time. The initial release of the game arrived on the Playstation 2 in North America on November 17, 2004 followed by Japan release on December 16, 2004. A European version was released the following year on March 4. The reader should be aware though that this review is based on the initial release of the game and not the secondary release, the remastered version released as a collection on the Playstation 3, or the Nintendo 3DS release.

## Review
The game is fun to play during free time if one is a fan of stealth games. Highly regarded as the best Metal Gear game by fans, many enjoy singing the theme song of the intro. Especially the phrase, "Snaaaaaaaaaaaaaake Eaaaaaater". You may have seen many people quote the famous line, "I give my life. Not for honor, but for you." or other variations of the quote. Perhaps may have even stumbled upon the picture of Snake saluting, usually posted when something sad has occured whether be online or in real life. The core fans hold the game as one of their most favorite childhood experiences.
Just as the previous games, the player is sent on an important mission and is able to sneak around and cycle through their inventory to strategize a tactful takedown of enemies. In this game, some new features that are added include camoflouge suits to assist blending in with the given environment and taking on enemies with hand to hand combat or as it is refered to as Close Quarters Combat (CQC).
As stated before, the game is fun to play however the controls can be a bit clunky at times.
