## Review
The game is fun to play during free time if one is a fan of stealth games. Highly regarded as the best Metal Gear game by fans, many enjoy singing the theme song of the intro. Especially the phrase, "Snaaaaaaaaaaaaaake Eaaaaaater". You may have seen many people quote the famous line, "I give my life. Not for honor, but for you." or other variations of the quote. Perhaps may have even stumbled upon the picture of Snake saluting, usually posted when something sad has occured whether be online or in real life.
