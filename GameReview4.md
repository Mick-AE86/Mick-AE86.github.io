# Title: Flicky
## Details:
Flicky was initially released in arcades in 1984 and ported on the Sega Genesis on April 1991 in North America. Before this release, there were other releases of the game such as the SG-1000 version and other consoles available only in Japan at the time. The goal of the game is to gather Flicky's lost chicks and guide them safely to the exit door while dodging predators that chase the player.
## Review:
As stated before the goal of each round is to collect and guide chicks (known in game as chirps) safely to the exit. The player is pursued by enemies such as tigers and iguanas (known in game as Tiger and Iggy respectively). The Tigers move horizontally and jump upon edges of a platform and the Iggys which are introduced in level 10 crawl along walls and move quickly. Levels (known in game as rounds) are set up in sections separated by bonus stages and with each section the map becomes more complex and difficult. For example at round 6 there are walls that bounce Flicky around and could either be helpful by assisting Flicky in dodging enemies or harmful by bouncing into them. The controls are responsive and there seems to be not much of an input lag. However there is a mechanic in which Flicky slides after moving left and right, how far it slides depends on the momentum of the movement. The player must take that feature into account when playing. The simple music loop that appears in each level is cheery and the loop transition is smooth. I even caught myself humming the tune within the first level. After getting a game over, I did not hesitate to pick up my controller and start a new game. 
## Final Thoughts:
This simple yet addicting game is fun and I did not stumble upon any hiccups in the software while playing. The music is simple yet effective. After losing the game, I would feel inclined to play again and attempt to make more progress in the arcade title.
