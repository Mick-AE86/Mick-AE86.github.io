## Heroku

Heroku can be integrated with github to help with testing code.
Heroku CI is fully integrated with Heroku Flow which includes Heroku Pipelines, Review Apps, and GitHub Deploys.
Heroku CI is compatable with the following languages: Go, Node, Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, Gradle, Scala, 
Clojure, and Elixir.
When working in teams, teams will be able to work with one another to commit changes to the pipeline and another feature makes communication with others convenient.
With CI, team members will be able to make requests and push their new lines of code for automatic testing in a disposable app. 
After each test, the user will be able to see the results in an organized matter and the results are assigned to a url for ease of access and sharing.
It is scalable and helps with the workload.

These features can be helpful When moving information and code along with a larger group of people and can be more efficient when testing new aspects of software during development.
