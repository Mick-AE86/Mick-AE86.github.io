* Game: Respawn


# Review

Respawn is a game that encourages the player to kill off their character in order to progress in the game. An awesome scientist 
named Seth creates a machine which allows him to respawn in the immediate area when he dies. An unnamed Evil Scientist sends his men to 
seize the new invention. With no choice but to flee, Seth throws his invention out the window and dives to his death. Eventually 
respawning in the area which the machine landed.

The game idea is interesting although the execution could be better. One inconvenience was the retrieval 
of the respawn machine. Instead of running off the buildings after dropping the machine, simply pressing "R" 
will respawn the machine into the player's hand. No pun intended. However the point is that the game itself doesn't make
reference of the mechanic. Another inconvenience is utilizing the "Z" button for zooming out the camera. The player
is most likely to be having their hand resting on the "WASD" buttons to move around, but having to completely shift one's
hands in order to press the button isn't as convenient as using the "Q" or "E" button. 
The game has an issue with respawning at times such that the player would be transported much further back than they were previously. When spawning in between gaps, the game doesn't seem to know what to do and instead kills the player, spawning the player as mentioned before or sometimes having to reset the game.
In a section of the game, the player traverses electrical poles to another area of building tops. During this section, the
player can die by touching the electrical wires. However on the last line of electrical wire, the player instead falls 
through the wire and splats on the ground. Perhaps an unexpected bug?
One of the more major issues with the game was the response times with the controls. There would be a bit of a delay and 
after stopping, the character would slide a bit too much. 

This complaint may not be from others, however when playing the game would slow down at times casuing the precise movement
needed to not be as precise.

Aside from those inconveniences, the game certainly has potential. While understandably the creators had a few weeks to 
put the game together, there could be improvements made to make the game more fun. With the tagline of "Dying has never been 
so fun" there could have been a mechanic to actually make dying more fun. Just throwing a machine and walking off a 
building is not as much fun as having the machine ricochet off of trampolines or using it in some way to defeat enemies.



# Final Thoughts

Respawn is a fun game to play for the most part. If the creators are able to go back and fix those minor issues, the game could be much better.
 In order to play the game, the user must have the last version of Unity Web Player made available as the program is no longer supported. The 
recommended browser to use is Internet Explorer as FireFox, Chrome, and Edge are not supported by the game.
