## Medal of Honor: European Assault

### Review: 
Medal of Honor European Assault is a First Person Shooter game developed by DICE and published by Electronic Arts. It released on Playstation 2, Xbox,and Nintendo Gamecube in June 2005. This game focuses on the European Theatre during the Second World War and stars Lieutenant Holt, an american sent to fight with the british army. The game is divided up into four sections and each section takes place in a different location. The first of which is a port town in France. The player takes part in what is known as Operation Chariot and gets tossed into the action, similar to previous titles in the franchise. The game play is eventful, the levels are a bit linear, and controls are old school shooter style (as in shooting is R1 and aiming is L1). 

This title introduces squad members which the player commands during each mission. The player should be mindful of their health as well since keeping your squad alive rewards the player with med kits which the player can use in the game. The levels offer a good amount of content as well. In each level there are a set of missions the player can accomplish, the primary objective which the player must accomplish to proceed, the secondary objective whih are optional but if completed the player is rewarded with revivals (revivals are used in the game to continue the mission when the player has been slain. It is convenient for not having to replay the level every time the player fails), the enemy officer objective which the player must take out a nazi officer, and a secret file objective in which the player must acquire secret nazi files containing plans on weapons manufacturing or war strategies. Completing more objectives rewards the player with high ranking medals.

The music is a favorite protion of mine as the dynamic track in the main menu makes the player feel like they themselves are the hero. The orchestraic mix of trumpets, human chorus, percussion, and other instruments create a variety of emotions of the hardships during the second world war. It could be thrown into an HBO documentary series and none would be the wiser that it came from a video game.

The presentation overall is fantastic and makes the player feel like they are listening to old war stories from those who have served. As the narrator talks about their service and operations, an old movie clip plays showing real footage from during the war. This in my opinion creates more of an immersion in the game.

### Final Thoughts:
Medal of Honor: European Assault is fun to play and for it's time did well to make the player feel they were part of a very important war. I have genuinely had a lot of fun playing the software and completing the extra objectives did not feel like a chore. They appeared as the player explored the level and were always optional but rewarding if completed. The dynamic music makes the player feel they are embarking on a crucial mission and the immersion of the title leaves me coming back for more, especially for those who are fans of history and the major wars of old.
