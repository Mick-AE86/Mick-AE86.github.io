# Medal of Honor: European Assault

## Review: 
Medal of Honor European Assault is a First Person Shooter game released on Playstation 2, Xbox,and Nintendo Gamecube in June 2005. This game focuses on the European Theatre during the Second World War and stars Lieutenant Holt an american sent to fight with a british army. The game is divided up into four sections and each section takes place in a different location. The first of which is a port town in France. The player takes part in what is known as Operation Chariot and gets thrown into the action. Similar to previous titles in the franchise. The game play is smooth and controls are old school shooter style (as in shooting is R1 and aiming is L1). This title introduces squad members which the player commands during each mission. The player should also keep watch of their health as well since keeping your squad alive rewards the player.
