### Game: Skullmonkeys
#### Platform: Playstation
#### Developer: The Neverhood Inc.
#### Publisher: Electronic Arts

  Released in the year 1997,
Skullmonkeys is a sidescroller platformer that is a sequel to The Neverhood, a point and click adventure game. The game is based around the main character Klaymen who is abducted while eating away on a sandwich. From the end of the first game, the antagonist Klogg is blasted away and lands on a planet known as Idznack. He comically becomes leader of a species known as the skullmonkeys and has them build Evil Engine 9 so that he can succeed in destroying the Neverhood.

  The game is fun to play and the design choice of animated claymation characters is something I personally like.There is a 90's aesthetic to the software. The humor is funny and the music is fun to listen to. For example at the beginning of the game, when Klogg plans to become ruler of the skullmonkeys, one of the skullmonkeys that is hiding behind a rock says confidently, "My people are far too smart to accept him as leader" in which the scene then cuts to the other skullmonkeys gathered around Klogg and suddenly praising him.
The music is a treat to listen to, the main menu music when popping in the disc is catchy and fun.
The creator of the Neverhood series is also the creator of Earthworm Jim series, thus the character designs often get compared to one another.

  While there may be some people that will say the game is difficult, I may have to disagree. The game was smooth to run and there didn't seem to be any lag between the control press and the character movement on screen. How the game rules work is one hit and the character dies unless they collect the Halo power up which acts as a temporary sheild against enemies and disappears after making contact with an enemy. The player can jump on the skullmonkey enemies to effectively destroy them similar to Mario jumping on enemies. 
  #####
All in all, I quite enjoyed the game, the mechanics are simple and it's not a long game to finish. The design is appealing and the humor is great. If you enjoy platformers and really like claymation, I would like to reccomend playing Skullmonkeys.
