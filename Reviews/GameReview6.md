### Game: Skullmonkeys
#### Platform: Playstation
#### Developer: The Neverhood Inc.
#### Publisher: Electronic Arts

Released in the year 1997,
Skullmonkeys is a sidescroller platformer that is a sequel to The Neverhood, a point and click game. The game is based around the main character Klaymen who is abducted while eating away on a sandwich. From the end of the first game, the antagonist Klogg is blasted away and lands on a planet known as Idznack. He comically becomes leader of a species known as the skullmonkeys and has them build Evil Engine 9 so that he can succeed in destroying the Neverhood.

The game is fun to play and the design choice of animated claymation characters is something I personally like. The humor is funny and the music is fun to listen to. For example at the beginning of the game, when Klogg plans to become ruler of the skullmonkeys, one of the skullmonkeys that is hiding behind a rock says confidently, "My people are far too smart to accept him as leader" in which the scene then cuts to the other skullmonkeys gathered around Klogg and suddenly praising him.
The music is a treat to listen to, the main menu music when popping in the disc is light and fun.
The design style often gets compared to Earthworm Jim and rightfully so since the creator of the Neverhood series is also the creator of Earthworm Jim.
The game really has 90's feeling to it.
